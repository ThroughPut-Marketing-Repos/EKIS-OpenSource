# Plugins

The simplified EKIS runtime does not use a plugin system. All integrations (Discord, Telegram, HTTP API, and exchanges)
are configured through `config.json` and managed by the core services in `src/`. This file is retained only to clarify
that no plugin development is required for the current version.
